# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes, guides, and templates. Use these docs to onboard, run, and continuously improve projects with consistent practices across teams.

## Purpose
Provide a single entry point that summarizes how OctoAcme runs projects and links to detailed process documents for each lifecycle phase.

## High-level process (lifecycle)
Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective

Core principles:
- Iterative delivery in small, testable increments
- Clear ownership and defined roles
- Data-informed decisions and measurable outcomes
- Stakeholder communication and risk management
- Continuous improvement and psychological safety

## Team rhythm & artifacts (brief)
- Daily standups: short, daily focus on progress and blockers
- Weekly delivery sync: progress, dependencies, flagged risks
- Demos/Reviews: at the end of sprint or milestone
- One-pager / Project Charter: problem, goals, success metrics
- Backlog & sprint planning: prioritized, estimated work with acceptance criteria
- PR conventions & CI: small PRs, tests, lint, approvals before merge
- Risk register & communication templates
- Retrospectives with actionable owners and follow-ups

## Recent Improvements

Created Role Participation Matrix and Process Checklists to improve accountability and clarity across all project phases.
